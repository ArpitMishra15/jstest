## 4 pillars
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

##
1. Abstraction
Definition: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.

In JS: Use classes or functions to expose only necessary methods.

##
2. Encapsulation
Definition: Bundling data (variables) and methods that operate on that data within one unit (class), and restricting direct access to some components.

##
3. Inheritance
Definition: One class (child) inherits properties and methods from another class (parent).

##
4. Polymorphism
Definition: Same method name behaves differently depending on the object/class that calls it.
